# Hospyta_mobileapp

This FOSS is for a local healthcare startup, which I am working on as a volunteer to help create a market solution. The react-native library, together with react-navigation, and reactjs was used.

## My Approach
I started with the onboarding screens; working to a create an adaptive, and responsive UI. Then moved onto the Authentication flow. Currently working on the Home screen

## Conclusion
Overall no bugs where encountered in making the solution
